I was on my late shift listening to Tay Swift
Tryna shake this lack of motivation
Seven months wasted, getting impatient
'Cause the spot under my arm is always vacant
Problems I created, yeah, I wasn't perfect
But I'm still tryna figure out what wasn't workin'
I'm flippin' through my playlist, every song that's playin'
Make me realize that since you've been gone

[Chorus]
My life sucks a little when you're oceans away
Stuck here and I'm feeling like I can't catch a break
But you made your decision when you hopped on that plane
Now I'm sippin' on rum and tequila, tryna numb all the pain

[Verse 2]
Hoppin' in my Jeep, got no destination
Vibin' like we used to before you were taken
Scroll through my feed, heard 'bout your engagement
Sorry, I forgot to post congratulations
And now I daydream, pretending nothing is wrong
And I've been faking like I don't wanna call
When I was faded, I saw your mom at the mall
And she said I should move on because her baby moved on
But my life sucks a little when you're oceans away
Now I'm stuck here and I'm feeling like I can't catch a break
But you made your decision when you hopped on that plane
Now I'm sippin' on rum and tequila, getting drunk
Now I'm sippin' on rum and tequila, tryna numb...
Now I'm sippin' on rum and tequila, getting drunk
Now I'm sippin' on rum and tequila, tryna numb all the pain

[Interlude]
Tryna numb all the pain
(Can I get another drink, please?)

[Chorus]
Now I'm sippin' on rum and tequila, getting drunk
Now I'm sippin' on rum and tequila, tryna numb...
Now I'm sippin' on rum and tequila, getting drunk
Now I'm sippin' on rum and tequila, tryna numb all the pain

[Outro]
I was on my late shift listening to Tay Swift
Tryna shake this lack of motivation
