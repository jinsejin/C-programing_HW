Lyrics: John K - cheap sunglasses

This is why I can't have nice things
'Cause I break 'em, I'll take 'em for granted, yeah
The second I tell you how I feel, I get anxious
And I don't understand I

Can't you see I'm trying
Oh, but every time, I
Blame it on the timing
I know it's a lot but
We've been lying closer
I've been getting colder
It's already over in my mind
Maybe that's why

I only buy cheap sunglasses 'cause
I know that I'll, know that I'll lose
Them sooner or later, oh, lately I
Can't keep anything, can't keep you
I only buy cheap sunglasses 'cause
I know that I'll, know that I'll lose
Them sooner or later, oh, baby I
Can't keep anything, can't keep you

This is why I can't have nice things, yeah
'Cause I question
Every person in my life, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
The second I, I put my heart out, yeah
Even just a little bit, yeah
I know you'll walk all over it

Can't you see I'm trying
Oh, but every time, I
Blame it on the timing
I know it's a lot but
We've been lying closer
I've been getting colder
It's already over in my mind
Maybe that's why

I only buy cheap sunglasses 'cause
I know that I'll, know that I'll lose
Them sooner or later, oh, lately I
Can't keep anything, can't keep you
I only buy cheap sunglasses 'cause
I know that I'll, know that I'll lose
Them sooner or later, oh, baby I
Can't keep anything, can't keep

You, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh
You, ooh, ooh-ooh
Can't keep anything, can't keep
You, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh
You, ooh, ooh-ooh
Can't keep anything

Can't you see I'm trying
Oh, but every time, I
Blame it on the timing
I know it's a lot but
We've been lying closer
I've been getting colder
It's already over in my mind
Maybe that's why

I only buy cheap sunglasses 'cause
I know that I'll, know that I'll lose
Them sooner or later, oh, lately I
Can't keep anything, can't keep you
I only buy cheap sunglasses 'cause
I know that I'll, know that I'll lose
Them sooner or later, oh, baby I
Can't keep anything, can't keep

You, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh
You, ooh, ooh-ooh
(Know that I'll lose, hey)
Can't keep anything, can't keep
You, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh
You, ooh, ooh-ooh
(Know that I'll lose, yeah yeah)
Can't keep anything
Can't keep you
